## Overview

This is home to my personal Kubernetes cluster. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches this Git repository and makes the changes to my cluster based on the manifests in the [cluster](./cluster/) directory. [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) also watches this Git repository and creates pull requests when it finds updates to Docker images, Helm charts, and other dependencies.

<!--For more information, head on over to my [docs](https://iudicael.github.io/home-cluster/).-->

## Thanks

A lot of inspiration for my cluster came from the people that have shared their clusters over at [awesome-home-kubernetes](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/awesome-home-kubernetes)
